Welcome to the world-contribution-java-source-code-bank for [Hypersoft Krypton](https://www.github.com/hypersoft/Krypton).

This code-bank is for Java Coders who wish to extend the functionality of 
Krypton, or those who wish to fork Krypton's power features in their own 
java-software-code-works. Please see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for data on any 
permissions you may need for your public-code-works.

Development Platform:

 * Gradle
 * Netbeans Mind Map
 
Suggested IDE: IntelliJ-IDEA 2017 or greater; with Gradle, and Netbeans Mind Map

<h5>Notice</h5>

Krypton is not currently using this code-bank.
The code-bank that Krypton currently uses is being outsourced to this code-bank.

You should feel free to hack-on and rip-from this code however you like, except 
that you should not plagiarize any code you have been given. Which means claim 
someone else's work as your own original work. In general, it is okay to take 
parts and pieces you need, however that's not really something you need to do if
you use XPR in the context it was made for.

<hr>

<h5>Contributing</h5>

All useful contributions are welcome. "Useful" means any technology, or comments
 [thoughts], which meet the goals of XPR as laid out in the XPR Logical 
 Architecture Map.

As far as contributions go, what this project really needs are code testers, 
platform-feature-compatibility-pull-requessts and people who like to whine, 
protest and complain about things <b>not working</b> in a way perceived to be 
logical (introspective reflections). If you find that something is not working,
and you cannot correct the issue on your own, please feel free to 
[file an issue](issues) on the problem you are having.

On the other hand, if you can correct a software issue, we would love to see 
your pull requests under the terms of share-and-share-alike (world-contribution for
world-contribution). If you don't comprehend the concept of pushing and pulling to 
and from online code-bases, you can always use good 'ol markdown syntax in 
conjunction with your favorite [Gist](https://www.gist.github.com) or 
[Pastebin](https://www.pastebin.com) and our [issues](issues) site, to submit 
your features, and fixes like a no-(non-sense/hassle)-coding-guru would.

Do you believe you have found a copyright or licensing issue concerning this
software? If you have You should go to the issues page and post a comment int 
the [Licensing](https://github.com/hypersoft/XPR/issues/1) issue.

Perhaps you have a suggestion? Why wait? Go to the 
[Suggestions](https://github.com/hypersoft/XPR/issues/1) issue and post a 
suggestion.

Something is missing? That sounds interesting enough. However, the case seems 
likely that; at this point, you should already have the 
[gist](https://www.gist.github.com) on filing [issues](issues) or other 
features you might be having/wanting.

<h3>What's in a name?</h5>
<h5>'Ol Unix C Standard Naming Conventions</h5>
Lazy. You practically might as well be writing machine code. Off the top of your
head, can you tell me what <code>dtoa, ftoa, fprint, printf, sprintf, malloc,
wcstomblen</code> mean? I know what all of these crypto codes mean. It means
learning a third-language to perform instructional speech in a second-language
which is translated into the primary (first) language[=machine-code]. Does the term lost in translation,
mean anything to you? You have to learn all of these languages to communicate
effectively with the hardware. Its not clear, and it certainly is not concise.

What generally happens is, most coders never see all of the logical connections,
and thusly their code is not very straight forward. Do you have to be, a
rocket-scientist to comprehend, that this situation is not ideal for
instructional purposes? What is the primary goal of writing software? Performing
computations through instructional machine interfaces. What is the primary goal
of writing a software-language? If you did not say "human-interface-device" you
got it wrong. Luckily you don't have to try again.

<h5>Java Naming Conventions</h5>
Java users recommend the <code>camelCaseNamingConvention</code> for Class fields
 and methods AKA properties. Java Classes use <code>TitleCaseNamingConventions
 </code> and packages use <code>lowercasenamingconventions</code> This is so that your code has a clear and consistent meaning that does
  not require source Browsing for Human Cognition in relation to identifier
  scope and context. That's a really neat trick.

<h5>XPR Naming Conventions</h5>
Nearly everything in user-land is FIRST-CLASS in XPR, which means
<code>TitleCaseNamingConventions</code>, and Hierarchial.Context.Class.Nesting. What is not first-class? Auxilliary
support. Getters/Setters and instance-storage-variables particularly. Things you
generally don't need to be concerned with until you reach a FIRST-CLASS-ENDPOINT.
Logically Input, is always greater than output, because the output doesn't 
exist without the Input. We are not concerned with what the user is thinking,
we are concerned with the logic of operations. Which means actually writing code
that looks well, and performs well in terms of getting from A TO B for a particular
goal.

So, if the user doesn't comprehend what is taking place, they are not actually
writing code in the real world. Furthermore, modern development environments
take care of the heavy lifting these days. Clear and Concise should always be
the goal for an API. Even if that means writing up your own naming convention,
especially when the common-practice is not up to par with logic or computaional
language.
 
 The difference between machine
 code and compiled code is simple in terms of communication. Its all in the
 name game. Monikers rule the day. If you use the correct-logic, you will get
 the correct output. Doesn't get any simpler than that.
