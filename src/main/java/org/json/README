JSON in Java [package org.json has been transferred and modified to XPR.JSON]

JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format.
See http://www.JSON.org/

The files in this package implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java.
It also includes the capability to convert between JSON and XML, HTTP
headers, XPR.JSON.Plus.Cookies, and XPR.JSON.Plus.CSV.

This is a reference implementation. There is a large number of JSON packages
in Java. Perhaps someday the Java community will standardize on one. Until
then, choose carefully.

The license includes this restriction: "The software shall be used for good,
not evil." If your conscience cannot live with that, then choose a different
package.

The package compiles on Java 1.6-1.8.


Variant: The Variant can parse text from a String or a Compiler
to produce a map-like object. The object provides methods for manipulating its
contents, and for producing a JSON compliant object serialization.

VariantList: The VariantList can parse text from a String or a Compiler
to produce a vector-like object. The object provides methods for manipulating
its contents, and for producing a JSON compliant array serialization.

Compiler: The Compiler breaks a text into a sequence of individual
tokens. It can be constructed from a String, Reader, or InputStream.

XPR.Fault: The XPR.Fault is the standard exception type thrown
by this package.

XPR.JSON.Type.Path: Implementation of 
[JSON Pointer (RFC 6901)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901). Supports
JSON Pointers both in the form of string representation and URI fragment
representation.

XPR.JSON.Serialization: The XPR.JSON.Serialization interface requires a XPR.JSON.Serialization.toJSON method,
allowing an object to provide its own serialization.

XPR.JSON.Builder: The XPR.JSON.Builder provides a convenient facility for
building JSON strings.

XPR.JSON.Builder: The XPR.JSON.Builder provides a convenient facility for building
JSON text through a writer.


XPR.JSON.Plus.CSV: XPR.JSON.Plus.CSV is the support for converting between JSON and comma
separated values.

XPR.JSON.Plus.Cookie: XPR.JSON.Plus.Cookie is the support for converting between JSON and cookies.

XPR.JSON.Plus.Cookie.Batch: XPR.JSON.Plus.Cookie.Batch is the support for converting between JSON and
cookie lists.

XPR.JSON.Plus.HTTP: XPR.JSON.Plus.HTTP is the support for converting between JSON and HTTP headers.

XPR.JSON.Plus.HTTP.Compiler: XPR.JSON.Plus.HTTP.Compiler extends Compiler for parsing HTTP headers.

XPR.JSON.Plus.XML: XPR.JSON.Plus.XML is the support for converting between JSON and XML.

XPR.JSON.Plus.XML.Kit: XPR.JSON.Plus.XML.Kit is the support for converting between JSONML and XML.

XPR.JSON.Plus.XML.Compiler: XPR.JSON.Plus.XML.Compiler extends Compiler for parsing XML text.

Unit tests are maintained in a separate project. Contributing developers can test

Numeric types in this package comply with ECMA-404: The JSON Data Interchange Format 
(http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf) and 
RFC 7159: The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-6). 
This package fully supports Integer, Long, and Double Java types. Partial support 
for BigInteger and BigDecimal values in Variant and VariantList objects is provided
in the form of get(), opt(), and put() API methods.

Although 1.6 compatibility is currently supported, it is not a project goal and may be
removed in some future release.

In compliance with RFC7159 page 10 section 9, the parser is more lax with what is valid
JSON than the Generator. For Example, the tab character (U+0009) is allowed when reading
JSON Text strings, but when output by the Generator, tab is properly converted to \t in
the string. Other instances may occur where reading invalid JSON text does not cause an
error to be generated. Malformed JSON Texts such as missing end " (quote) on strings or
invalid number formats (1.2e6.3) will cause errors as such documents can not be read
 reliably.
